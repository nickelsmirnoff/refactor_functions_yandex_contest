This is my project, solving the refactoring problem from Yandex-Contest

File "template.py" contains about 200 strings of code with 
uneffective functions for solving the specific problem.

Problem is to make this template code as short as possible(the goal is to reduce the number of lines of code and number of symbols used)

File "refactored.py" contains shortened code of "template.py"
and some tests for checking correct answers of functions 

My refactored functions are implemented with 20 strings of code instead of 200.

My solution is quite close to optimal solution I think
